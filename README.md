# IronCrypt Network Vulnerability Patch Management using LLM

This project is specifically designed to automate and streamline the entire workflow of vulnerability analysis and remediation. It initiates by ingesting vulnerability scan outputs, specifically in the form of XML files generated by network scanners like Nmap. Upon receiving this raw scan data, the system intelligently processes and categorizes the identified vulnerabilities based on their severity, providing a clear and prioritized overview of potential risks. This structured vulnerability data then informs the patch management process, where the system facilitates the implementation of necessary security patches. To demonstrate this functionality in a controlled environment, we have simulated a Linux server setup within a Docker container, allowing for safe and repeatable testing of patch deployments. Furthermore, the platform integrates an AI-powered chatbot that serves as an interactive assistant, capable of answering queries related to vulnerabilities, offering remediation guidance, and providing insights into the overall cybersecurity posture. Complementing this, the interactive Office Floorplan Visualizer component offers a unique spatial awareness of your assets, depicting their physical location and allowing security teams to quickly identify and address vulnerabilities geographically within an organizational layout.

## Project Overview

The Cyber Risk Visualizer is a robust and comprehensive platform designed to empower organizations in proactively managing their cybersecurity posture. In today's complex threat landscape, simply identifying vulnerabilities is not enough; effective risk management requires a real-time understanding of assets, their associated vulnerabilities, and the ability to rapidly deploy remediation actions. This project aims to bridge that gap by integrating several key functionalities into a unified, interactive dashboard.

The core objective is to provide security teams with a holistic view of their cyber risks, enabling them to:
*   **Identify and Prioritize Vulnerabilities**: Aggregate vulnerability data from various sources and present it in a clear, actionable format, allowing teams to prioritize based on severity and impact.
*   **Visualize Asset Locations**: Understand the physical distribution of assets within an environment (e.g., an office floorplan) and instantly see their security status, helping to contextualize risks.
*   **Streamline Patch Management**: Facilitate the efficient deployment of security patches to vulnerable systems, reducing the window of exposure to known exploits.
*   **Provide Intelligent Assistance**: Offer an AI-powered assistant to help interpret complex security data, answer queries, and guide users through remediation processes, effectively augmenting human expertise.
*   **Improve Situational Awareness**: By combining vulnerability data with asset location and real-time patching status, the system provides an unparalleled level of situational awareness, critical for rapid incident response and proactive risk mitigation.

Ultimately, the Cyber Risk Visualizer transforms raw security data into actionable intelligence, allowing organizations to maintain a strong security posture, minimize their attack surface, and protect critical assets from evolving cyber threats.

## Architecture and Components

The system is composed of several interconnected services working in concert:

1.  **Frontend (`cyber-risk-visualizer-main`)**: A modern web application built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. It provides the user interface for visualizing data, interacting with the different dashboards (Vulnerability, Floorplan, Patch Management), and communicating with the backend API and LLM assistant.

2.  **Backend (Python Flask API - `src/api.py`)**: A Flask-based API written in Python. This server acts as the central hub for data processing, business logic, and database interactions. It handles requests from the frontend, processes vulnerability data, manages patch deployment orchestrations, and serves data back to the frontend.

3.  **LLM Assistant (`llm_assistant/main.py`)**: A separate Python application that hosts the AI chatbot functionality. It processes natural language queries from the frontend, leverages a Large Language Model to generate responses, and can potentially interact with other backend services to fetch specific security information or recommend actions.

4.  **Docker**: Used for containerizing the entire application, providing a consistent and isolated environment for deployment. It simplifies the setup process by packaging all dependencies and configurations.

5.  **Ansible (`patch.yml`)**: An automation engine used for orchestrating the patch management process. The backend server leverages Ansible playbooks to securely connect to remote systems (e.g., via SSH) and execute patch commands, ensuring consistent and automated remediation across the infrastructure.

These components communicate through standard network protocols (HTTP/HTTPS) and APIs, ensuring a modular and scalable architecture.

## Getting Started

Follow these detailed steps to set up and run the entire Cyber Risk Visualizer system on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

*   **Node.js**: Version 18 or later.
*   **npm**: Comes with Node.js.
*   **Python**: Version 3.9 or later.
*   **pip**: Comes with Python.
*   **Docker Desktop**: For containerization.
*   **Ansible**: For patch management automation.
*   **Bun**: (Optional) A fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime, useful for frontend package management and execution. If you prefer `npm`, you can use that instead.

### Installation and Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    First, clone the project repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd SocGen
    ```
    (Note: The root directory is `SocGen` as per the project layout.)

2.  **Set up the Frontend Server:**
    This is the React application that provides the user interface.

    *   Navigate into the frontend project directory:
        ```bash
        cd cyber-risk-visualizer-main
        ```
    *   Install the JavaScript dependencies. You can use `npm` or `bun`:
        ```bash
        npm install
        # OR
        bun install
        ```
    *   To run the frontend in development mode:
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        # OR
        bun run dev
        ```
        The frontend server will typically start on `http://localhost:5173`. Keep this terminal running.

3.  **Set up the Backend Server:**
    This is the Flask API that handles data and business logic.

    *   Open a **new terminal** and navigate back to the project root directory (`SocGen`):
        ```bash
        cd /Users/prasadpai/Desktop/SocGen # Adjust this path if different
        ```
    *   Create a Python virtual environment to manage dependencies:
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        ```
    *   Activate the virtual environment:
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source venv/bin/activate
            ```
        *   On Windows:
            ```bash
            .\venv\Scripts\activate
            ```
    *   Install the Python dependencies for the backend:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Run the Flask backend application:
        ```bash
        export FLASK_APP=src/api.py # Set the Flask application entry point
        flask run
        ```
        The backend API will typically be accessible at `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. Keep this terminal running.

4.  **Set up the LLM Assistant Server:**
    This is a separate Python application for the AI chatbot.

    *   Open another **new terminal** and navigate to the LLM assistant directory:
        ```bash
        cd /Users/prasadpai/Desktop/SocGen/llm_assistant # Adjust this path if different
        ```
    *   Create a Python virtual environment (if you haven't already, or use a separate one for isolation):
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv_llm
        ```
    *   Activate the virtual environment:
        *   On macOS/Linux:
            ```bash
            source venv_llm/bin/activate
            ```
        *   On Windows:
            ```bash
            .\venv_llm\Scripts\activate
            ```
    *   Install the Python dependencies for the LLM assistant:
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        ```
    *   Run the LLM assistant script:
        ```bash
        python main.py
        ```
        Ensure this script is configured to listen on a specific port, and the frontend/backend can communicate with it as necessary. Keep this terminal running.

### Docker Setup (Alternative Full System Deployment)

Instead of running each server individually, you can use Docker to build and run the entire application as a set of containers. This method provides a more consistent deployment environment.

1.  **Ensure Docker Desktop is running.**

2.  **Build the Docker image:**
    From the project root directory (`SocGen`), execute:
    ```bash
    docker build -t cyber-risk-visualizer .
    ```
    This command reads the `Dockerfile` and builds an image containing your application.

3.  **Run the Docker container:**
    Once the image is built, you can run it:
    ```bash
    docker run -p 5173:80 cyber-risk-visualizer
    ```
    This command maps port 5173 on your host machine to port 80 inside the container, making the application accessible via `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser.

### Ansible Usage

Ansible is used for orchestrating patch deployment. The `patch.yml` file is an Ansible playbook.

*   The `ansible.cfg` file contains configuration for Ansible.
*   The `hosts` file defines the inventory of target machines.
*   The `docker_ssh/id_rsa.pub` is likely a public SSH key used for authentication by Ansible to target machines.

When the backend triggers a patch operation, it will likely invoke Ansible using the `patch.yml` playbook and the defined `hosts` to connect to remote servers and execute specified patch commands. Ensure your Ansible setup is correctly configured, including SSH keys, for seamless operation.

## Usage

Once all servers (Frontend, Backend, LLM Assistant) are running, or the Docker container is active, open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.

*   **Vulnerability Dashboard**: Explore and filter vulnerabilities by various criteria.
*   **Office Floorplan Visualizer**: Interact with the floorplan to see asset locations and their security status.
*   **Patch Management**: Initiate and monitor patch deployments.
*   **AI Assistant**: Use the chatbot to ask questions about vulnerabilities, receive guidance, and get recommendations.
